Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order. 
SELECT year FROM Movie
JOIN Rating ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
WHERE Rating.stars = 4 OR Rating.stars = 5
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;


Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 
SELECT title FROM Movie
LEFT JOIN Rating ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID

Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.
SELECT Reviewer.name, Movie.title, Rating.stars, Rating.ratingDate FROM Rating
LEFT JOIN Reviewer ON Rating.rID = Reviewer.rID
LEFT JOIN Movie ON Rating.mID = Movie.mID
ORDER BY name, title, stars;
